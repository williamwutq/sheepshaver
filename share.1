.SH DESCRIPTION
.B share
is a utility to synchronize files between a local directory tree and a shared directory, preserving relative paths. It is useful for sharing files between different users or systems.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The local root (SHARE_PATH) and shared root (SHARED_ROOT) can be customized:
.TP
~/.sharepath
Absolute path to the local root directory. Only files under this directory are managed.
.TP
~/.shareroot
Absolute path to the shared root directory. Defaults to ~/Shared/dump if not set.
.TP
**/.shareignore
Patterns of files to ignore during operations, similar to .gitignore. When recursive operations are performed on directories, files matching these patterns will be skipped. However, this will not affect the pushall, pullall, and syncall commands, which always consider all files beneath SHARE_PATH.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --help, -h
Display help information about the share utility.
.TP
.B --version, -v
Display the version of the share utility.

.TP
The following flags can be used to control the verbosity of the output:
.TP
.B --suppress-extra, --no-extra, -next, -sext
Suppress extra informational messages.
.TP
.B --suppress-error, --no-error, -nerr, -serr
Suppress error messages.
.TP
.B --suppress-critical, --no-critical, -ncrt, -scrt
Suppress critical error messages.
.TP
.B --suppress, --no, -no, -s
Suppress all messages except critical errors.
.TP
.B --ignore <pattern>, -i <pattern>
Specify additional ignore patterns (can be used multiple times).

.SH COMMANDS
.TP

List all files in shared directory.
.TP
.B put <path> [...]
Copy file(s) to shared (always overwrite). If input is a directory, put all files under it.
.TP
.B push <path> [...]
Copy to shared only if local is newer. If input is a directory, push all files under it.
.TP
.B pushall
Push all local files to shared if local is newer.
.TP
.B get <path> [...]
Copy from shared to local (always overwrite). If input is a directory, get all files under it.
.TP
.B pull <path> [...]
Copy from shared only if shared is newer. If input is a directory, pull all files under it.
.TP
.B pullall
Pull all shared files to local if shared is newer.
.TP
.B sync <path> [...]
Sync by copying whichever is newer. If input is a directory, sync all files under it.
.TP
.B syncall
Sync all files by copying whichever is newer.
.TP
.B check <path> [...]
Check sync status of file(s).
.TP
.B rm <path> [...]
Remove file(s) from shared location.
.TP

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
share put rust/cargo.toml
share README.md
share push rust/cargo.toml src/main.rs
share check rust/cargo.toml src/main.rs
share list
share status
share status rust src

.SH NOTES
- Only files under SHARE_PATH are managed. Attempts to share files outside this path will be rejected.
- The mapping preserves the relative path under SHARE_PATH in SHARED_ROOT.
